# Electrical Calculator 

A application I made for my electrical engineering class that calculates **serial** and **parallel** resistor calculations based on values you give it. 
It will give you the total resistance and the tolerance interval. 
It will also recommend a fitting resistor from the **E24 Series** based on what the result is. 

# TODO
-[ ] Implement logical gate calculations
